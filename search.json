This presentation reflects his recent journey, having attended machine learning classes at his alma mater last year, and represents his practical experiments applying these concepts to his publishing business with Clojure tools.\nHe lives in the Czech Republic, in city of Brno.12:00Open Practice 2AbstractWe will spend some time together practicing the tools, methods, and ideas we have seen at other talks.13:00Computer Graphics with Clojure, LWJGL, and FastmathAbstractsfsim is a space flight simulator under development. It makes use of Clojure, LWJGL, and Fastmath among other libraries. More than half of the code deals with graphics. This talk gives a short introduction using LWJGL's cross-platform OpenGL bindings to get started with rendering data from NASA's CGI Moon Kit.Read more at Clojure CivitasSpeakerJan WedekindJan studied compiler construction and robotics and later did a PhD in computer vision. He currently works in industry developing inspection software. His first programming languages were Omikron Basic and later Borland Pascal. In industry he used C++, Ruby, and Python. In his spare time he got interested in Ruby, GNU Guile, and finally Clojure.14:00 - 16:00Macroexpand 3AbstractThis meeting is part of the macroexpand gatherings series. It will focus on discussing the state of our community and initiating new projects for the near future. The session will begin by a few brief experience reports and proposals by participants. Then we will expand the discussion till we converge to actionable steps we will follow up on.16:00Noj FoundationsAbstractThis will be a tutorial session about some of the relevant high-performance libraries behind Noj such as ham-fisted, dtype-next, and tech.ml.dataset. See the session we had with Harold last May -- you may expect something similar.SpeakersHaroldOwner: TechAscent - Mathematician | Software Engineer | Cloud (AWS) | Clojure | JS | Data Science | AI/ML\n Daniel SlutskyDaniel Slutsky is a data scientist at Endor Global, part of a team of Clojurians building a wellness app using biometric data from wearable devices.

It has been built with AI assistance right from the beginning. Four months into the implementation, I have gained some experience with AI assisted coding, which I'd like to share in this talk.\nFirst I like to give an overview of QClojure to set the stage. I will show the tools and the workflow for AI assisted coding, including some prompts. Then we look at the actual process of working with the AI. Finally I will give you some of my best practices and summarize with the lessons learned.\n\n\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\nLudger Solbach\nLudger Solbach is a software architect for 'msg for automotive' in Germany. He is the creator of Overarch, a lightweight system modeling and visualization tool and QClojure, a library for programming quantum computers. His favorite programming language by far is Clojure, a modern functional LISP. He uses it for his open source work, at work when feasible, and to create models for his 3D-Printer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Dynamic Entity Extraction with Bosquet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nEvery text processing application needs to answer a question: what is this text about? Named entity extraction is one part of the answer to this. It identifies and links words to real-world entities—turning \"Macroexpand 2025\" into structured data about a specific technology conference happening in a specific year.\nThis extraction process involves multiple steps that can be implemented using LLMs. This presentation demonstrates how Bosquet, an LLM orchestration library, can help with building entity extraction pipelines.\n\n\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\nŽygimantas Medelis\nAuthor of Bosquet, Clojure user since its v1.0. I have been working with unstructured text data processing for over a decade - hence the topic of the talk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14:00\n\n\n\n\nPanel: AI assistants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe will have a conversation with a few of the toolmakers behind Clojure's main AI assistants.\n\n\n\nSpeakers\n\n\n\nEric Dallo\nEric Dallo is a Emacs, NixOS fanatic, he loves programming, especially when focused on dev tooling, He maintains clojure-lsp, ECA, deps-bin, lsp-mode, and other related libraries, Eric works with Clojure at Nubank and currently is focused on AI pair programming multi-editors with ECA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Stromberg\nPeter Strömberg is a curious coder since 40+ years and is extra fascinated by making software that he uses do new things. These days he practically lives in VS Code and is making Clojure related extensions for it. Peter maintains Calva, Joyride, and Calva Backseat Driver. Backseat Driver is an AI extension for VS Code Copilot, giving the AI tools for using the Clojure REPL, as well as for structural editing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Hauman\nBruce Hauman is a prolific toolmaker and long-time contributor to the Clojure community, perhaps best known as the creator of Figwheel—the build tool that introduced live code reloading and made real-time browser development a reality for ClojureScript developers. Bruce’s legendary 2014 “Flappy Bird” demo not only turned heads, but set a new standard for interactive coding, enabling developers to see their changes instantly and stay in the creative flow. Bruce also built Devcards, a library for interactive documentation that brings a visual REPL experience to ClojureScript, and Rebel Readline, the feature-rich REPL for Clojure and ClojureScript, complete with syntax highlighting, code completion, and inline documentation. Bruce’s latest project, Clojure MCP, tackles the next frontier: enabling AI assistants to work Clojure projects by connecting directly to live REPLs, providing real-time feedback and validation to improve the quality of AI-generated Clojure code. Beyond his tool building chops, Bruce is guided by a profound respect for users and a conviction that developer tooling should be radically better—simple, powerful, and joyful to use. He’s also a fan of the outdoors: an avid canoe tripper, Appalachian Trail thru-hiker, and, currently, the hands-on renovator of a former church-turned-home in Saskatchewan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPanel: broader implications of AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe will discuss the broader implications of the AI rush, a few of the ways it affects our lives, and what we might be able to do about it.\n\n\n\nSpeakers\n\n\n\nKira Howe\nKira's been writing software for the past decade with a focus on data-intensive web apps and a particular interest in Clojure programming and data visualization. She loves open source development, fostering communities online and in-person, and learning new things. When she's not at her desk, you can find Kira teaching yoga, playing violin, or running with her dog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay McDermott\nRay has decades of experience writing commercial software for databases, finance, manufacturing and cloud services. He is a Clojure enthusiast and advocate and produces and participates in several podcasts and YouTube channels. The impact of hyper-scaled LLMs is the subject of his most recent project.

This talk will go over all of the pieces involved in voice ai from best models to use, turn detection, context management to scripting and instruction following to hosting and scaling. By the end you will better understand what it takes to build highly reliable voice AI agents with Clojure\n\n\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\nStoica Ovidiu\nOvidiu Stoica is a software developer with 10 years of experience, out of which the last 5 are in Clojure. He has been building voice AI agents for the last 1.5 years for enterprise clients and is the creator of simulflow - a voice AI agent clojure framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17:00\n\n\n\n\nArchitecting reliability in LLM systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nLarge Language Models have captured the imagination of developers worldwide, yet many LLM-powered systems fail in production despite impressive demos. The root cause is often not technical incompetence, but rather an over-optimistic faith in LLM capabilities without accounting for their fundamental limitations. Just as an engineer hanging a heavy shelf wouldn't rely solely on manufacturer specifications without safety margins, building reliable LLM systems requires a \"Murphy's Law\" mindset that anticipates failure modes.

We will then discuss the underlying methodology of probabilistic programming more systematically through the Daphne compiler, and how it provides different ways to compile a subset of Clojure simulator programs to neural network architectures, and as of lately also CUDA. The goal of this discussion is to provide understanding of both the methodology and applications of probabilistic programming, as well as to gather more feedback from the Clojure community to render Daphne not only an academic platform, but also more practical. One such potential practical integration we will discuss is with LLMs that can help with the simulator construction.\n\n\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\nChristian Weilbach\nChristian Weilbach is a long-time Clojure developer working on distributed systems such as replikativ, Datahike, and supporting libraries.

But the Python ecosystem's dirty secret is that most of the libraries holding the system together are wrappers around C/C++ libraries that do most of the important work. Jank is the native Clojure dialect built on compiler technologies like LLVM, giving it access into the same native libraries powering the Python ecosystem. As Jank heads towards its first alpha release, its most highly anticipated feature, seamless C++ interop is already capable of wrapping and using native C++ libraries for machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this talk, we will show how to leverage Jank's C++ interop to wrap the most popular deep learning library in usage right now, libtorch, which most would have known through its Python frontend, PyTorch. As a proof of concept, we will display an implementation of GPT-2, the LLM released in 2019 using our Torch wrapper. This talk will give Clojure practitioners interested in using Clojure for ML/AI a glimpse into the future of how important C++ libraries can be utilized with Jank.\n\n\n\nSpeakers\n\n\n\nMonty Bichouna\nMonty is an aspiring compiler engineer who enjoys Lisps and always wanted a reason to learn Clojure.

The root cause is often not technical incompetence, but rather an over-optimistic faith in LLM capabilities without accounting for their fundamental limitations. Just as an engineer hanging a heavy shelf wouldn't rely solely on manufacturer specifications without safety margins, building reliable LLM systems requires a \"Murphy's Law\" mindset that anticipates failure modes. Through our experience building StartCheck, a production document analysis platform, we've learned that true reliability comes from understanding and designing around core LLM limitations: input quality sensitivity, task complexity degradation, reasoning constraints, output length trade-offs, hallucinations, and consistency challenges.SpeakerSiavash MohammadySiavash is a Clojure developer with a knack for trying new things and crafting solutions through creative combinations of technology.
